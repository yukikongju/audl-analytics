# Projects

- Dashboard
    * visualize player pass zone
- Team Strategy with RL
- Possession Outcome: Predicting Turnover/Scores based on throwing sequences using LSTM
	1. Feature Engineering
	    a. Play metadata: num_passes, num_hucks, num_turnovers, 
	       play_duration, num_handlers, num_receivers
	    b. Throws Sequence Encoding: dump -> throw -> swing -> huck
	    c. Spatial Features: avg_pass distance, std_pass_angle, possession_heatmap
	    d. Team Metadata: completion_perc, 
- Scouting Report Summarization with ChatGPT
- Play Classification
    * Ask ChatGPT to label sequence, which can be used to understand plays distribution
    * Cluster Play Together
	1. 
- Social Network Analysis
- Which Playstyle is the best? 
    * Players => Player Style Clustering (aggressive handler, safe cutter); Win above replacement (WAR)
    * Teams => Team Style Clustering (possessions, deep ball, small ball, ...)
